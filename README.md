### **Chrome extension boilerplate**

This started template allows you create a browser extension(see part of '**Deploy extension**') width customise view popup and so difficult background script structure


This template doesn't depend on anything frontend frameworks, but core example use the react.

 **If you wanna develop on other framework** you need build your app, **without chunks**, it must be single bundle, and **put it in** `content` **root directory** with `bundle.js` name
